# RAG-Blueprint-
RAG-BluePrint is a notebook-driven mini-book that teaches RAG from the ground up. Each chapter explains one architectural component with diagrams, minimal code, and runnable examples — no heavy frameworks, no hidden abstractions. A clear, practical way to master Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
